\beforelist* This package was originally created to have a way to test completed
parts of the project that needed to interact with hardware that hadn't been
built yet.
It is made up of different modules:
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \Code|fakeboard|
  \item \Code|fakedisplay|
  \item \Code|fakeeb|
  \item \Code|fakejoystick|
  \item \Code|fakeled|
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}
\afterlist
Each one of these can work independently from the others, but they all need a
real game to be running, either on the actual board or on a different device
(e.g.\ on a PC).

Each module mimics a particular hardware component of the project, offering an
intuitive graphical representation of it, as shown in \autoref{fig:demo}. If the
real counterpart is present (either inside the board or remotely connected to
it), the virtual component will show its current status, otherwise it will
simulate it.

\beforelist* This interface, however, doesn't only offer visual feedback of what
is going on in the game, but also allows interaction with the virtual
devices.
In fact, it is possible to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item control the joystick with the keyboard (similarly to the virtual
    joystick interface shown in \autoref{ssec:vint});
  \item press or release the \textquotedblleft{}everything button\textquotedblright{};
  \item simulate a hit on a totem.
\end{itemize}
\afterlist*
Although it was created for debugging and testing purposes, this interface
(fully or in part) can be used to play the game without needing to mount the
real board (saving time and space, but probably losing in fun).
Since a simulated robot isn't available, however, only the Simon Says mode can
be played this way.
