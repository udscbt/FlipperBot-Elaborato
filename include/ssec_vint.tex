\autoref{fig:vcontr} shows a screenshot of the interface. The labels refer to
its components:
\begin{description}
\item[\intfref{connect}:]
  \textit{Connection button}. Allows to start and stop a connection with a board
  or a robot (the WiFi connection to the right network must be done outside of
  this program).
\item[\intfref{joystick}:]
  \textit{Virtual joystick}. Simulates a real joystick, showing its current
  position and accepting user input.
\item[\intfref{options}:]
  \textit{Options}. Allow to enable or disable certain features of the virtual
  interface on the fly, enhancing the user experience.
\item[\intfref{hint}:]
  \textit{Hint text}. Briefly explains what's the meaning of an option when the
  cursor goes over it.
\end{description}

Depending on the selected options, it's possible to control the device either
with a keyboard (arrow keys or number pad) or with the mouse (or with both at
the same time). Regardless of the enabled input method for controlling the
joystick, a virtual everything button is always bound to the \Verb|Return|
keyboard key.

If the child commonly uses a hardware or software solution
that simulates a keyboard or a mouse, it can be used with this interface too.
