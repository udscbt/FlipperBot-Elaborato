\beforelist \autoref{fig:vcontr} shows a screenshot of the interface. The labels
refer to its components:
\begin{description}
\item[Connection button:] allows to start and stop a connection with a board
  or a robot (the WiFi connection to the right network must be done outside of
  this program);
\item[Virtual joystick:] simulates a real joystick, showing its current
  position and accepting user input;
\item[Options:] allow to enable or disable certain features of the virtual
  interface on the fly, enhancing the user experience;
\item[Hint text:] briefly explains what is the meaning of an option when the
  cursor goes over it.
\end{description}
\afterlist*
Depending on the selected options, it is possible to control the device either
with a keyboard (arrow keys or number pad) or with the mouse (or with both at
the same time). Regardless of the enabled input method for controlling the
joystick, a virtual \textquotedblleft{}everything button\textquotedblright{} is always bound to the \Verb|Return|
keyboard key.

If the child commonly uses a hardware or software solution
that simulates a keyboard or a mouse, it can be used with this interface too.
