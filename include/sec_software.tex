In addition to designing and building the physical parts of this
project, a considerable amount of work was put in developing the
software needed to make the various devices operate as wanted.

The main programming languages used were C++ and Python, with some
utilities written as Bash scripts.

Snippets of the code contained in this project can be found in
\autoref{app:code}, together with examples of use of the various tools.
