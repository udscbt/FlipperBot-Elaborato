The Raspberry Pi on the board runs the Raspian operating system, a GNU/Linux
system built specifically for this device.

All the software we developed to run on the RPi was written in Python,
specifically it was tested on version \Verb|3.5.2|.

\beforelist* Considering the large number of different and, sometimes, unrelated
tasks the board has to carry out, we opted for a very modularized structure.
The \Code|flipperbot.board| package, containing all the Python code specifically
developed for the board, is in fact divided in the following modules:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \Code|audio|
  \item \Code|display|
  \item \Code|everythingButton|
  \item \Code|game|
  \item \Code|led|
  \item \Code|server|
  \item \Code|shared|
  \item \Code|simonsays|
  \item \Code|totems|
\end{itemize}
